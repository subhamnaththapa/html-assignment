          <h2>  About Me</h2>
          <p>  Myself Subham Nath Thapa, born on June 21 <sup>st</sup> 2003. I have a passion for <em>technology</em> and love exploring new advancements in the tech world. I also enjoy learning and exploring new things like photography, videography and color grading. In my free time, I like to read about <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> and its potential to transform industries.</p>
          <p>  I have a background in computer science and I am currently studying Diploma in Interactive Media Design because of my interest in Interactive Media and web development. My goal is to use my skills to create solutions that can help people and improve their lives. I believe that with the right mindset and dedication, anything is possible.</p>
